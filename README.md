# Color Activity (Using Spinner)

**CIS 3515 Introduction to Mobile Application Development - Assignment 3**

This Android application uses a custom adapter that allows a user to select a color from a Spinner. Once a color is selected, the background of the activityâ€™s layout changes to the selected color. If the user changes their selection to a different color, the background color will change accordingly.
